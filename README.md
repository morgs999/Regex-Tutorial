# Regex Tutorial

## Description
This repo contains a link to the Github Gist I produced to document a regex tutorial.

## Installation and Usage
Visit the [Github gist](https://gist.github.com/morgs999/2111bff1ce0a05ca733361f2e71261bf) and you can follow along as I explain the individual elements of this regex expression:
```
/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/
```

which is designed for matching URLs within a set of text.
